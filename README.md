#jquery.edittr

jquery.edittr is a [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com/) plugin that adds editing functionality to table rows. A table row is given an additional cell with an "Edit" link. When clicked, "editable" cells in that row will change to form elements, allowing the content to be edited.

Minified version size: ~2kb

##Basic usage

1. Include `jquery.edittr.css` with your other CSS files.
2. Each table row must have a cell with an `edit` class. This will house the function links and can appear anywhere in the row.
3. Call jquery.edittr on the table (or the table's wrapper) that you want to be able to edit: `$('#my-table').edittr();`
4. Every cell within that table with a class of `editable` will now allow its contents to be edited.

The `name` value would be converted to a text input element:
```
<tr>
  <td class="name editable">Stephen</td>
  <td class="edit"></td>
</tr>
```

##Advanced usage

### Checkboxes

By adding a `data-checkbox` attribute, the `drinks` value would be converted to a set of checkboxes:
```
<tr>
  <td class="drinks editable" data-checkbox='{"coffee":"Coffee","pop":"Pop","water":"Water"}'>Water</td>
  <td class="edit"></td>
</tr>
```

### Radio buttons

By adding a `data-radio` attribute, the `gender` value would be converted to a set of radio buttons:
```
<tr>
  <td class="gender editable" data-radio='{"female":"Female","male":"Male"}'>Male</td>
  <td class="edit"></td>
</tr>
```

### Select menu

By adding a `data-select` attribute, the `handedness` value would be converted to a select menu:
```
<tr>
  <td class="handedness editable" data-select='{"left":"Left","right":"Right"}'>Left</td>
  <td class="edit"></td>
</tr>
```

##Options

###I18n

You can provide text for the Edit, Save and Cancel links by passing in those values as options during initialization:
```
$('#my-table').edittr({
  editText:'Ã‰diter',
  saveText:'Accepter',
  cancelText:'Annuler'
});
```
Defaults are "Edit", "Save" and "Cancel".

###Silent mode

There are a few console messages to help ensure you're using the plugin properly. If you prefer, you can supress these messages:
```
$('#my-table').edittr({
  silent:true
});
```

###Callbacks

The Edit, Save and Cancel actions have their own callbacks: `onEdit`, `onSave` and `onCancel`.

```
$('#my-table').edittr({
  onSave: function() {
    //add your saving magic here
  }
});
```
